# Morning Code

This repo contains the code from this morning. I was originally going to do something with reversing the name, but ended up doing something different, hence the misleading Title etc

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone it as normal
3. Change into the top level of the project
4. Run `npm install` or `npm ci` to pull in the dependencies
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the project
